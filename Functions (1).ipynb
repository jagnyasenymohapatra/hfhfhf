Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",

In this case, the number of attempts is not predetermined, and you want to keep checking the condition (whether the password is correct) until it’s true. This is a perfect scenario for a while loop, because you don’t know how many attempts it will take for the user to provide the correct password, but you want to continue prompting them as long as the condition (correct password) is not met.\n",
